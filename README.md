  DSDB (Simple Database System) is a project that implements a basic database system capable of storing and indexing data using B-trees,
  AVL trees, and Red-Black trees. The system efficiently handles the storage and retrieval of data related to the leading causes of 
  deaths in different states of the USA. With support for multiple index trees, DSDB allows users to create indices based on specific
  data fields. It provides operations such as point search, range search, and update, allowing users to search for specific data tuples,
  retrieve data within a specified range, and modify existing records. DSDB ensures the uniqueness of keys and handles duplicates by
  maintaining linked lists associated with each key. Overall, DSDB provides a user-friendly interface and efficient 
  indexing capabilities for managing and analyzing data effectively.
